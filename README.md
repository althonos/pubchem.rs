## üîå Usage

### üíä Compound

Create a `Compound` to query the PubChem API for a single compound. It can
be constructed from a compound ID, from a compound name, from an InChI or
InChIKey, or from a SMILES string:

```rust
extern crate pubchem;

let alanine = pubchem::Compound::new(5950);
let aspirin = pubchem::Compound::with_name("aspirin");
let acetone = pubchem::Compound::with_inchi("InChI=1S/C3H6O/c1-3(2)4/h1-2H3");
let lysine  = pubchem::Compound::with_inchikey("KDXKERNSBIXSRK-YFKPBYRVSA-N");
let benzene = pubchem::Compound::with_smiles("C1=CC=CC=C1");
```

Use the methods to query the REST API with [`ureq`](https://crates.io/crates/ureq).
Dedicated methods exist for common single properties:

```rust
let alanine = pubchem::Compound::new(5950);

alanine.title().unwrap(); // "Alanine"
alanine.molecular_formula().unwrap(); // "C3H7NO2"
alanine.canonical_smiles().unwrap(); // "CC(C(=O)O)N"
alanine.isomeric_smiles().unwrap();  // "C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N"
```

Each method will perform a single query to the PubChem API, which is inefficient
if you wish to retrieve several properties at once. In that case, use the
`properties` method and select which properties you want to retrieve
in a single query:

```rust
use pubchem::CompoundProperty::*;

let properties = pubchem::Compound::new(5950)
    .properties(&[Title, MolecularFormula, CanonicalSMILES])
    .unwrap();

properties.molecular_formula; // Some("C3H7NO2")
properties.canonical_smiles; // Some("CC(C(=O)O)N")
properties.isomeric_smiles; // Some("C[C@@H](C(=O)O)N")
```

To retrieve metadata from multiple compounds at once, use the `Compounds`
struct and use the `properties` method to pack everything into a single
query:

```rust
use pubchem::CompoundProperty::*;

// retrieve metadata from the three aromatic L-amino acids at once
for prop in pubchem::Compounds::new([6140, 145742, 6305])
    .properties(&[Title, IUPACName, ExactMass])
    .unwrap()
{
    println!(
        "[{cid}] {title} {iupac} {mass}g/mol",
        cid = prop.cid,
        title = prop.title.unwrap(),
        iupac = prop.iupac_name.unwrap(),
        mass = prop.exact_mass.unwrap(),
    );
}
```
